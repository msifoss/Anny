2. **Gym startup content** — owns the "how to start a gym" journey across 8+ verticals, which captures future buyers
3. **Membership category authority** — Google ranks you page 1 for "membership" itself (position 1.2, 8K impressions)

## Strategic Takeaway

The content moat isn't about competing with Mindbody or Glofox on generic "gym software" terms (where Member Solutions sits at position 38). It's that Member Solutions owns the entire journey — from "should I open a BJJ gym?" to "how do I price memberships?" to "I need billing software." That funnel capture is what the CrossFit page converting at 5.7% proves out.
