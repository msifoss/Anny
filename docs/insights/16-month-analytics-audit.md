# Member Solutions — 16-Month Analytics Audit

**Period:** November 2024 through February 2026
**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Sources:** Google Analytics 4, Google Search Console

---

## The Story in One Paragraph

In November 2024, Member Solutions was invisible online — a login portal where 97% of organic clicks came from people already searching the brand name, supported by $1,500+/month in Google Ads and Meta spend. By mid-2025, someone made a bet: kill the paid spend, publish dozens of vertical-specific content pieces targeting aspiring gym owners, and let organic do the work. Sixteen months later, the bet is paying off. Organic daily clicks nearly tripled (23.6 → 68.9), impressions exploded 10x (80K → 550K/quarter), and a new channel nobody planned for — AI referrals from ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude — is now delivering more sessions than paid search ever did. The brand didn't change. The audience didn't change. But the strategy flipped from renting traffic to owning it.

## Q1: November 2024 – February 2025
### "The Paid-Search-and-Login-Portal Era"

### The Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| GA4 Sessions | 15,341 |
| GA4 Daily Avg | 127 |
| SC Clicks | 1,439 |
| SC Daily Organic Clicks | 23.6 |
| SC Impressions | 80,171 |
| SC Avg Position | 47.1 |
| Conversions Tracked | 0 |

### Five Things That Define This Period

**1. Paid search was a real budget line.**
Google Ads (CPC) drove 1,537 sessions at an engagement rate of 0.55 and avg session duration of 109 seconds. Cross-network (likely Google Display/Performance Max) added 340 more sessions. There was also a "Paid Other" channel with 14 sessions (probably a test). Combined: **~1,891 paid sessions/quarter**, roughly 12% of all traffic.

| Paid Channel | Sessions | Eng. Rate | Avg Duration |
|-------------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Paid Search (Google CPC) | 1,537 | 0.55 | 109s |
| Cross-network | 340 | 0.48 | 75s |
| Paid Other | 14 | 0.71 | 352s |
| **Total Paid** | **1,891** | | |

**2. The site was a login portal, not a destination.**
`/log-in/` drove 9,978 sessions and `/` drove 7,263. Together: 80% of all site traffic. The next page down was `/get-in-touch/` at 597 sessions. There was essentially no content layer.

**3. Search was 96% branded.**
Brand queries ("member solutions," "membersolutions login," etc.) accounted for 96.2% of all organic clicks. Non-brand clicks: 82 total for the quarter. Average position 47.1 means the site was on page 5+ for anything non-brand.

**4. Desktop dominated, mobile was expensive.**
73% of sessions were desktop (bounce rate 0.42) vs 26% mobile (bounce rate 0.61). Mobile users bounced 45% more than desktop — suggesting the site wasn't optimized for mobile content consumption.

**5. Pure US market — minimal international presence.**
USA accounted for 2,560 of 3,236 SC clicks (79%). Canada was a distant second at 348. India showed 104 clicks but at poor positions. The content simply didn't reach global audiences.

### The Vibe
A functional SaaS product website. Customers logged in. Prospects found it through brand search or Google Ads. No thought leadership, no content strategy, no organic discovery engine. The site existed to serve existing customers, not attract new ones.

## Q2: March – June 2025
### "The Content Bet Begins, Paid Gets Cut"

### The Numbers

| Metric | Value | vs Q1 |
|--------|-------|-------|
| GA4 Sessions | 21,914 | +43% |
| GA4 Daily Avg | 181 | +43% |
| SC Clicks | 2,664 | +85% |
| SC Daily Organic Clicks | 29.3 | +24% |
| SC Impressions | 199,920 | +149% |
| SC Avg Position | 38.1 | Improved from 47.1 |
| Conversions Tracked | 0 | — |

### Five Things That Define This Period

**1. Paid search was slashed by 66%.**
Google CPC dropped from 1,537 sessions to 522 — a dramatic pullback. Cross-network (Display/P-Max) went from 340 to 561 sessions, suggesting budget shifted toward awareness. But the biggest new paid entry was **Meta (Facebook/Instagram) at 660 sessions** — a brand new paid social experiment.

| Paid Channel | Q1 | Q2 | Change |
|-------------|-----|-----|--------|
| Paid Search (Google CPC) | 1,537 | 522 | **-66%** |
| Cross-network | 340 | 561 | +65% |
| Meta (paid social) | 0 | 660 | **NEW** |
| Paid Social (Facebook) | 0 | 9+12 | NEW |
| **Total Paid** | **1,891** | **~1,764** | -7% |

Total paid traffic held roughly steady, but the *composition* shifted from search to social. This was a strategy pivot.

**2. Meta/Facebook social exploded — then something interesting happened.**
Organic Social jumped from 26 sessions (Q1) to 769 sessions (Q2). This 2,858% increase, combined with the new Meta paid channel (660 sessions), tells a clear story: the team launched a Facebook/Instagram strategy in Q2 with both paid amplification and organic posting.

**3. `/member-management-software/` went from 62 sessions to 561.**
Someone invested in the product page. It went from barely visited to a real traffic driver — a 9x increase.

**4. Partner referrals deepened.**
apsfinancial.com nearly doubled (631 → 1,155) and youbill.com surged from 71 to 316 sessions (+345%). The payment processing partnership channel was growing independently of any marketing effort.

**5. ChatGPT appeared as a real channel.**
From 7 sessions in Q1 to 36 in Q2. Small, but notable: 24 unique users found the site through ChatGPT in Q2. Claude.ai also appeared for the first time (8 sessions). The AI referral channel was born.

| AI Source | Q1 | Q2 |
|-----------|----|----|
| ChatGPT | 7 | 46 |
| Perplexity | 1 | 3 |
| Claude | 0 | 8 |
| **Total AI** | **8** | **57** |

### The Vibe
A team in transition. Cutting Google Ads, experimenting with Meta, investing in a product page, starting to see AI referrals trickle in. The content strategy isn't fully visible yet in search rankings (impressions tripled but positions are still poor), but the seeds are being planted.

---

## Q3: July – October 2025
### "The Content Avalanche Lands — Paid Goes to Near Zero"

### The Numbers

| Metric | Value | vs Q1 |
|--------|-------|-------|
| GA4 Sessions | 23,994 | +56% |
| GA4 Daily Avg | 196 | +54% |
| SC Clicks | 3,235 | +125% |
| SC Daily Organic Clicks | 35.2 | +49% |
| SC Impressions | 388,882 | **+385%** |
| SC Avg Position | 29.9 | Improved from 47.1 |
| Conversions Tracked | 21 (Sep-Oct) | First ever |

### Five Things That Define This Period

**1. Paid search was effectively killed.**
Google CPC collapsed from 522 sessions (Q2) to just **10 sessions** in Q3. Cross-network: gone. Meta paid: gone. The paid budget went from ~$1,500+/quarter equivalent to functionally zero.

| Paid Channel | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Change (Q1→Q3) |
|-------------|-----|-----|-----|-----------------|
| Paid Search (Google CPC) | 1,537 | 522 | 10 | **-99.4%** |
| Cross-network | 340 | 561 | 0 | -100% |
| Meta/Paid Social | 0 | 681 | 0 | -100% |
| **Total Paid** | **1,891** | **1,764** | **10** | **-99.5%** |

This is the clearest strategic signal in the entire dataset: the team bet everything on organic.

**2. Twenty+ new content pages appeared in search rankings simultaneously.**
This was not a slow drip — it was a content avalanche. At least 20 new pages showed up in Search Console for the first time this quarter:

| Content Theme | Example Pages | SC Clicks |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| Gym startup guides | CrossFit mistakes, Boxing cost, BJJ guide, Rock climbing, Taekwondo plan | 30-162 |
| Membership concepts | Types of memberships, Subscription vs membership | 162 |
| Industry comparison | Best membership management software | 42 |
| Marketing/ops | Martial arts ads, Pilates marketing, TikTok fitness trends | 15-26 |
| Billing/finance | Payment reminder templates, Gym invoice template | 12-33 |

The editorial thesis crystallized: **help people who are starting or running a membership-based fitness business.** Every article targeted a specific vertical (CrossFit, BJJ, boxing, taekwondo, pilates, rock climbing) or a specific operational challenge (pricing, billing, newsletters, marketing).

**3. Conversions appeared for the first time.**
September 2025: 14 conversions. October: 7. Whether this is new tracking or genuinely new conversion behavior, the timing is not coincidental — it aligns perfectly with content pages getting indexed and ranking.

| Converting Page | Conv Rate |
|----------------|-----------|
| /crossfit-gym-business-mistakes-avoid/ | 3.6% |
| /blog/ | 5.0% |
| /types-of-memberships/ | 0.6% |

**4. Facebook/social traffic appeared organically — then vanished.**
m.facebook.com drove 991 sessions in Q3 (+ 134 from facebook.com), making social the third-largest channel. But this was organic social, not paid. Someone was posting content that resonated on Facebook — likely the new blog content being shared. This would not last.

**5. ChatGPT traffic 3x'd in a single quarter.**
ChatGPT went from 46 sessions (Q2) to 162 in Q3. The August spike was dramatic (46 sessions in one month). Perplexity grew to 17 sessions. Gemini appeared (3 sessions). Copilot appeared (4 sessions).

| AI Source | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 |
|-----------|----|----|-----|
| ChatGPT | 7 | 46 | 162 |
| Perplexity | 1 | 3 | 17 |
| Gemini | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| Claude | 0 | 8 | 0 |
| Copilot | 0 | 2 | 4 |
| **Total AI** | **8** | **57** | **186** |

AI referrals now exceeded what Paid Other, Organic Video, and several referral sources delivered. Nobody was optimizing for this channel — the content was simply good enough that LLMs cited it.

### The Vibe
The defining quarter. Paid search dies, 20+ content pages appear, conversions begin, AI referrals triple. This is when the transformation became irreversible. The old Member Solutions (login portal + Google Ads) was replaced by the new Member Solutions (content hub + organic).

---

## Q4: November 2025 – February 2026
### "The Ranking Battle — Impressions Explode, Positions Climb"

### The Numbers

| Metric | Value | vs Q1 (baseline) |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| GA4 Sessions | 18,958 | +24% |
| GA4 Daily Avg | 173 | +36% |
| SC Clicks | 4,951 | **+244%** |
| SC Daily Organic Clicks | 45.4 (avg) / **68.9 (Feb)** | **+192% (Feb)** |
| SC Impressions | 925,535 | **+1,054%** |
| SC Avg Position | 15.7 | Improved from 47.1 |
| Conversions | 35 | From 0 |

### Five Things That Define This Period

**1. Paid search is gone — and nobody misses it.**
Zero paid search sessions. Zero cross-network. Zero paid social. The entire acquisition model is now organic + direct + referral + email + AI. Total paid in Q4: **0 sessions**.

| Paid Channel | Q1 (baseline) | Q4 (current) |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| Paid Search | 1,537 | 0 |
| Cross-network | 340 | 0 |
| Paid Social | 0 | 0 |
| **Total Paid** | **1,891** | **0** |

The money that was going to Google Ads is now effectively being invested in content production. And organic search is delivering more sessions than paid ever did: 6,534 organic search sessions in Q4 vs 1,537 paid search sessions back in Q1.

**2. The impression explosion signals Google sees topical authority.**
Monthly SC impressions:
- Nov 2024: 41,395
- Jun 2025: 89,847
- Oct 2025: 141,403
- Jan 2026: **337,152**
- Feb 2026 (17 days): **214,069** → pace of ~380K

That's not linear growth — it's exponential. Google is testing Member Solutions content across a rapidly expanding set of queries. The biggest impression pages:

| Page | Impressions (Q4) |
|------|-----------------|
| /best-membership-management-software/ | 190,525 |
| /best-personal-training-software/ | 87,959 |
| /professional-payment-reminder-email-templates/ | 63,488 |
| /types-of-memberships/ | 47,791 |
| /tiktok-fitness-trends-gym-owners-guide/ | 33,318 |
| /average-gym-profit-margin/ | 28,856 |

**3. Engagement quality jumped dramatically across every channel.**
This is the sleeper story. Pages per session went from 1.5 to 2.5 for organic search. Engagement rate went from 0.59 to 0.81. This means the new content is *actually good* — people aren't bouncing, they're reading multiple pages.

| Channel | Pages/Session (Q1) | Pages/Session (Q4) | Eng. Rate (Q1) | Eng. Rate (Q4) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Organic Search | 1.8 | **2.5** | 0.59 | **0.81** |
| Direct | 1.5 | **2.3** | 0.50 | **0.73** |
| Referral | 1.5 | **2.4** | 0.47 | **0.74** |
| Email | 1.5 | **2.5** | 0.64 | **0.82** |

Every single channel improved in engagement quality. Bounce rates dropped across the board — mobile bounce went from 0.61 to 0.18. This suggests a site-wide redesign or UX improvement happened alongside the content strategy.

**4. AI referral traffic consolidated as a real channel.**
Monthly AI referral breakdown:

| Month | ChatGPT | Perplexity | Gemini | Claude | Total AI |
|-------|---------|------------|--------|--------|----------|
| Jan 2025 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| Apr 2025 | 16 | 0 | 0 | 7 | 23 |
| Jul 2025 | 16 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 22 |
| Aug 2025 | 46 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 49 |
| Sep 2025 | 62 | 6 | 3 | 0 | 71 |
| Nov 2025 | 68 | 4 | 3 | 0 | **75** |
| Dec 2025 | 44 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 51 |
| Jan 2026 | 38 | 12 | 4 | 2 | **56** |
| Feb 2026* | 26 | 6 | 7 | 2 | **41** (17 days → ~73/mo pace) |

Key observations:
- **ChatGPT is the dominant AI referrer** — 10-20x larger than any other AI source
- **Perplexity is growing fastest** — 0 → 12/month, with acceleration in 2026
- **Gemini appeared** in July and is now consistent at 3-7/month
- **Claude sends occasional traffic** — small but notable given it's a newer consumer product
- **Total AI traffic in Q4: ~250 sessions** — this now exceeds what Paid Other, Organic Video, and DuckDuckGo deliver. It's a real channel.

At current trajectory, AI referrals will deliver **800-1,000 sessions in 2026** — roughly what Paid Search delivered in its last full quarter (Q2 2025).

**5. International search presence is materializing.**
The content strategy didn't just work in the US — it unlocked international visibility:

| Country | Q1 Clicks | Q4 Clicks | Change |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| USA | 2,560 | 3,386 | +32% |
| Canada | 348 | 416 | +20% |
| India | 104 | 130 | +25% |
| UK | 37 | **121** | **+227%** |
| Australia | 18 | **77** | **+328%** |
| France | 0 | **49** | NEW |
| Mexico | 0 | **44** | NEW |
| Malaysia | 0 | **36** | NEW |
| Germany | 0 | **34** | NEW |

UK impressions went from 8K to 66K — an 8x increase. Australia from 1.2K to 23K. France, Mexico, Malaysia, and Germany are entirely new markets showing up in search. The educational content (membership types, pricing strategies, gym startup guides) has universal appeal that transcends the US market.

## The Channels That Matter in 2026

### Channel Waterfall: Then vs Now

| Channel | Q1 (Nov24-Feb25) | Q4 (Nov25-Feb26) | Trend |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Direct | 8,870 (58%) | 9,796 (52%) | Stable base |
| Organic Search | 3,345 (22%) | 6,534 (34%) | **Primary growth engine** |
| Paid Search | 1,537 (10%) | 0 (0%) | **Eliminated** |
| Referral | 1,040 (7%) | 2,236 (12%) | Growing (partners) |
| Cross-network / Paid | 340 (2%) | 0 (0%) | Eliminated |
| Email | 140 (1%) | 261 (1%) | Steady |
| AI Referrals | 8 (<0.1%) | ~250 (1.3%) | **Fastest growing** |
| Organic Social | 26 (<0.1%) | 91 (0.5%) | Rebounding |

### What to Watch in 2026

**1. AI Referrals Are the New "Dark Social"**
AI-referred sessions are almost certainly undercounted. When someone asks ChatGPT "what's the best membership management software" and it names Member Solutions, many users will Google the brand name rather than click the citation link. This means some of the brand search growth and direct traffic growth is actually AI-influenced but unattributed.

Recommendation: Track branded search volume trends alongside AI referral traffic. If branded search grows in months where AI referrals spike, the true AI influence is larger than GA4 shows.

**2. The Paid-to-Organic Migration Created a Better Business**
The math is striking:
- Q1: 1,891 paid sessions → ~$1,500-3,000/quarter ad spend (estimated) → engagement rate 0.55, avg duration 109s
- Q4: 6,534 organic sessions → $0 ad spend → engagement rate 0.81, avg duration 192s

Organic visitors engage 47% longer, view 67% more pages, and cost nothing at the margin. The quality of traffic improved while the cost dropped to zero. This is not a temporary arbitrage — it's a structural improvement.

**3. Mobile Experience Transformed**
Mobile bounce rate dropped from 0.61 to 0.18 — a 70% improvement. This is extraordinary and suggests either a site redesign, mobile optimization, or fundamentally different content that holds mobile readers. In SC data, mobile clicks grew from 1,853 to 2,661 while mobile impressions went from 37K to 261K. Mobile is where the content growth is happening — people searching "how to start a boxing gym" from their phones.

**4. The "Types of Memberships" Page is an SEO Unicorn**
From 0 sessions/clicks in Q1 to 416 SC clicks and 413 GA4 sessions in Q4 — and it's only at position 4.2 with 47K impressions. This page has realistic potential to reach position 1-2, which at 47K impressions could mean 2,000+ clicks/quarter. It's the single highest-potential page in the portfolio.

**5. The /best-membership-management-software/ Update Worked — But There's a Catch**
The December 18th content update delivered +24% daily clicks vs Q4 baseline (exceeding the 15% OKR). But the page has 190K impressions at position 24 — meaning Google is showing it everywhere but not yet rewarding it with page-1 ranking. Getting this page from position 24 to position 10 would be the single highest-ROI SEO action available, potentially unlocking thousands of additional monthly clicks for the core product keyword.

**6. International Is an Untapped Growth Layer**
UK (+227%), Australia (+328%), and four entirely new countries appeared in Q4. The content doesn't need localization — membership pricing, gym startup advice, and billing templates are relevant everywhere English is spoken. If international impressions are growing at 8x with zero effort, targeted international content (UK gym regulations, Australian fitness industry data) could accelerate this.

**7. The Social Channel Collapsed — Intentionally or Not?**
Organic social went from 769 (Q2) → 1,163 (Q3) → 91 (Q4). That's a 92% drop. Combined with paid social going from 681 to 0, this suggests Facebook/Instagram was either intentionally deprioritized or the person managing it left. Given the content library now available, social could be reactivated as an amplification channel for the blog content with minimal effort.

## The Transformation Scorecard

| Dimension | Nov 2024 | Feb 2026 | Change |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------|
| Organic daily clicks | 23.6 | 68.9 | **+192%** |
| Monthly impressions | 41,395 | 214,069+ | **+417%** |
| Non-brand click share | 3.8% | 12.2% | **+221%** |
| Content pages ranking | ~5 | 40+ | **+700%** |
| Paid search sessions | 1,537/qtr | 0 | **-100%** |
| AI referral sessions | 8/qtr | ~250/qtr | **+3,025%** |
| Engagement rate (organic) | 0.59 | 0.81 | **+37%** |
| Pages/session (organic) | 1.8 | 2.5 | **+39%** |
| Mobile bounce rate | 0.61 | 0.18 | **-70%** |
| Countries with 30+ clicks | 2 | 7 | **+250%** |
| Monthly conversions | 0 | 13+ | From zero |

## The Verdict

This is a textbook case of a SaaS company transitioning from paid acquisition dependency to organic content authority. The bet — kill the ad spend, publish deeply vertical content targeting aspiring gym and studio owners, and let organic compound — took about 8 months to show clear results and is now accelerating.

The most remarkable part isn't any single metric. It's that **every quality signal improved simultaneously**: engagement rate, pages per session, bounce rate, session duration, conversion rate, and international reach all went up while paid spend went to zero. That doesn't happen by accident. It happens when the content genuinely serves the audience.

The next chapter of this story is about conversion optimization (only 9 pages convert — the other 30+ content pages have zero CTAs), position improvement (hundreds of thousands of impressions at position 12-25 waiting to be unlocked), and deciding whether the AI referral channel is worth actively optimizing for.
