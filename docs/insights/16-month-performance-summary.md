## The Story in One Sentence

You stopped renting traffic and started owning it — organic is up, paid is gone, and a new AI referral channel appeared that nobody planned for.

---

## What Happened

**Nov 2024:** A login portal. 97% of organic clicks were brand searches. ~$1,500+/mo in paid social. No content strategy.

**Feb 2026:** A content engine. Paid social killed (-98%). Organic search clicks nearly doubled (+90%). Impressions 3x'd to 550K+/quarter.

## The Numbers That Matter

| Metric | Then (Nov '24–Feb '25) | Now (Nov '25–Feb '26) | Change |
|--------|----------------------:|---------------------:|-------:|
| Organic clicks/qtr | 3,000 | 5,700 | +90% |
| Google impressions/qtr | 170K | 550K+ | +3x |
| Content pages ranking | 0 | 12 | New |
| Paid social sessions/qtr | 1,800 | 32 | -98% |
| Bounce rate | 47% | 16% | -66% |

## Three Things to Act On

1. **`/best-membership-management-software/`** — 196K impressions, position 23, 0.07% CTR. Push this to page 1 and it's your highest-value organic keyword.

2. **ChatGPT is now a traffic channel** — 180 sessions/quarter, more than Yahoo or any social platform. AI referrals will grow as your content gets cited more.

3. **The content strategy is working but the funnel isn't closed** — people find you through articles about starting gyms, but only 9 of 40+ content pages have CTAs. That's leaving conversions on the table.
